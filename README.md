# Professor-Profile-Template
I have designed a template for a professor website using bootstrap css

# This is a really nice template with static data majorly lorem ipsum place holders. 
I have applied the principles of website creation from http://webstandards.hhs.gov/guidelines/
So it's a pretty good design, arguably better than what most professors use currently. 

Feel free to make use of the template.
